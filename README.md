# sanity.io/create starter template starter for Netlify

This is a barebones example of how to create a starter template for <a href="https://www.sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io/sanity-template-netlify-poc">sanity.io/create</a>.

It contains a template folder with a simple web site and the studio. These will be set up as two projects on Netlify from the same repo. The configuration is found in `sanity-template.json`.

Go to our [work in progress documentation for starter templates](https://www.sanity.io/docs/starter-templates).

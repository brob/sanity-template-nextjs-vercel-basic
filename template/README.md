This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

*In order to run locally, you'll need to change the values in `.env.test` and rename to `.env`.*

### Running the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Running the Studio

```bash
npm run start:sanity
```

This will copy the `.env` file from the root into your `/studio` directory for Studio to run. Once it's done being built, you can open [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).
